**Equipment ID:** MIL-001 to MIL-005

#### SOP: CNC Machining Operations

**Pre-Operation Checklist:**
1. Verify machine is properly powered on and warmed up
2. Check tool magazine for correct tooling setup
3. Verify chuck or vise is properly secured
4. Load work program from memory or USB
5. Perform dry run cycle to verify program

**Safety Requirements:**
- Always wear safety glasses in manufacturing area
- Remove loose clothing and jewelry
- Keep hands clear of rotating spindle
- Never open guards while spindle is rotating
- Use chip breakers and guards for all operations

**Shutdown Procedure:**
1. Complete current operation
2. Return turret to safe position
3. Stop spindle rotation
4. Remove finished parts safely
5. Clean work area and equipment
6. Log operation hours
7. This is a new line

**Maintenance Schedule:**
- Daily: Visual inspection, chip removal
- Weekly: Coolant level check, spindle cleanliness
- Monthly: Tool offset verification, calibration check
- Quarterly: Full preventive maintenance cycle

### Automated Turning Centers

**Equipment ID:** MIL-010 to MIL-012

#### SOP: Turning Center Operations

**Setup Procedure:**
1. Load material into automatic feeder
2. Verify tool turret positioning and offsets
3. Program feed rates appropriate for material
4. Test with first piece inspection
5. Monitor first 5-10 pieces before full production

**Material Handling:**
- Steel: Feed speeds 200-400 SFM
- Aluminum: Feed speeds 400-800 SFM
- Brass: Feed speeds 300-600 SFM
- Cast Iron: Feed speeds 100-200 SFM

**Inspection Intervals:**
- Every 25 pieces for critical dimensions
- Every 100 pieces for secondary dimensions
- Log all inspection data on work order

### Precision Grinding Systems

**Equipment ID:** MIL-020, MIL-021

#### SOP: Grinding Operations

**Wheel Selection:**
- Verify correct wheel for material type
- Check wheel balance before operation
- Confirm wheel specs match setup documentation

**Coolant Management:**
- Maintain coolant at proper concentration
- Change coolant every 30 days
- Monitor for contamination

**Tolerances:**
- Surface finish: Ra 0.4-0.8 microinches
- Dimensional tolerance: ±0.0005"
- Verify with precision gage before and after shifts

## Welding & Assembly Stations

**Equipment ID:** ASM-001 to ASM-003

#### SOP: Welding Operations

**Pre-Weld Inspection:**
1. Verify work pieces are clean and free of contaminants
2. Check welding electrodes or wire for damage
3. Set amperage and voltage per joint specifications
4. Test equipment on scrap material before production run

**Welding Parameters by Material:**
- Steel plate (3mm): 120-150A, 25-30V
- Steel tubing (2mm): 80-110A, 20-25V
- Stainless steel: 100-140A, 22-27V

**Quality Standards:**
- No porosity or voids in weld bead
- Visual inspection 100% of welds
- Dimensional verification per drawing tolerance
- Surface finish smooth with minimal spatter

**Post-Weld Procedures:**
1. Remove flux or spatter as required
2. Cool parts naturally (do not quench unless specified)
3. Perform dimensional verification
4. Document weld parameters and inspector sign-off

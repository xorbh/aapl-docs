# Equipment Maintenance and Management

## Maintenance Philosophy

Equipment is critical to our operational success. Preventive maintenance reduces unexpected downtime, extends equipment life, and ensures product quality. All equipment maintenance follows established procedures and documentation requirements.

## Maintenance Strategy

### Maintenance Types

**Preventive Maintenance (PM)**:
- Scheduled maintenance at regular intervals
- Oil changes, filter replacements, lubrication
- Wear component replacement before failure
- Reduces unplanned downtime by 75%

**Predictive Maintenance (PdM)**:
- Condition-based maintenance monitoring
- Vibration analysis for rotating equipment
- Thermal imaging for electrical components
- Ultrasound for leak detection
- Allows detection of impending failures

**Corrective Maintenance**:
- Repair of equipment failures
- Emergency response for critical breakdowns
- Root cause analysis to prevent recurrence
- Planned corrective actions for minor issues

## Equipment Master List

Maintained in computerized Maintenance Management System (MMS):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Equipment ID | Unique identifier (e.g., MIL-001) |
| Description | Make, model, serial number |
| Location | Production area and specific location |
| Criticality | Critical/Important/Standard classification |

### PM Work Orders

Generated automatically 2 weeks before PM due date:
- Includes equipment history and specifications
- Lists all tasks to be performed
- Specifies parts and materials needed
- Identifies required tools and safety precautions
- Includes estimated duration and craft skills needed

## Maintenance Execution

### Maintenance Personnel

**Skill Levels**:
- **Level 1 (Operator Maintenance)**: Daily checks, basic cleaning, minor adjustments
- **Level 2 (Production Maintenance)**: PM execution, minor repairs, parts replacement
- **Level 3 (Maintenance Technician)**: Complex diagnostics, major repairs, equipment commissioning
- **Level 4 (Specialist)**: Vendor-specific equipment, engineering support, training

### Work Order Process

1. **Generation**: MMS creates PM work order automatically
2. **Preparation**: Technician reviews work order and gathers materials
3. **Scheduling**: Coordinated with Production to minimize downtime
4. **Execution**: Work performed following documented procedures
5. **Documentation**: All work logged with times and parts used
6. **Verification**: Supervisor verifies work completion
7. **Sign-Off**: Equipment cleared for production use

### Safety During Maintenance

- LOTO procedures always followed when required
- Confined space entry protocols if applicable
- Hot work permits for welding/cutting
- Fall protection for elevated work
- Temporary guards installed during maintenance
- Warning signs and barriers in place

## Predictive Maintenance Program

### Condition Monitoring

**Vibration Analysis**:
- Monthly measurements on rotating equipment
- Baseline established during commissioning
- Trending to identify developing problems
- Failure patterns documented for early warning

**Thermal Imaging**:
- Quarterly surveys of electrical and mechanical systems
- Temperature anomalies investigated
- Bearing overheating detected early
- Motor winding problems identified

**Oil Analysis**:
- Samples taken from hydraulic and gear systems quarterly
- Tests include viscosity, contamination, wear metals
- Trends indicate component wear progression
- Chemical breakdown detected

**Ultrasonic Inspection**:
- Monthly monitoring of bearing lubrication
- Cavitation detection in pumps
- Electrical discharge mapping
- Leak detection in sealed systems

### Data Management

- All readings entered into MMS

- Alerts generated when thresholds exceeded
- Root cause analysis for abnormal conditions
- Maintenance recommendations generated automatically

## Spare Parts Management

### Critical Spare Parts Inventory

Maintained for equipment with:
- Long lead times (>2 weeks)
- Single sources
- High failure frequency
- Critical to production

Typical critical parts:
- Bearing sets and seals
- Hydraulic pumps and motors
- Electrical motors and contactors
- Drive belts and chains
- Cutting tool holders

### Spare Parts System

## Emergency Maintenance Response

### Unplanned Equipment Failure

Response procedure:
1. **Stop Production**: Safely power down equipment (LOTO if necessary)
2. **Notify Maintenance**: Immediately contact maintenance supervisor
3. **Assess Damage**: Preliminary assessment of failure extent
4. **Documentation**: Photo documentation of failure
5. **Root Cause**: Begin diagnosis of failure cause
6. **Estimate**: Time and cost estimate for repair
7. **Notification**: Inform Production of expected downtime
8. **Repair**: Execute corrective maintenance as quickly as possible

### Critical Equipment Failure

For failures affecting production more than 4 hours:
- Contact equipment vendor for support
- Evaluate temporary alternative solutions
- Prepare capital request for replacement if repair uneconomical
- Document all costs
- Conduct failure analysis meeting

## Equipment Upgrades and Replacement

### Capital Equipment Assessment

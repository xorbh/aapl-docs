### Maintenance Types

**Preventive Maintenance (PM)**:
- Scheduled maintenance at regular intervals
- Oil changes, filter replacements, lubrication
- Wear component replacement before failure
- Reduces unplanned downtime by 75%

**Predictive Maintenance (PdM)**:
- Condition-based maintenance monitoring
- Vibration analysis for rotating equipment
- Thermal imaging for electrical components
- Ultrasound for leak detection
- Allows detection of impending failures

**Corrective Maintenance**:
- Repair of equipment failures
- Emergency response for critical breakdowns
- Root cause analysis to prevent recurrence
- Planned corrective actions for minor issues

**Steps:**

1. **Generation**: MMS creates PM work order automatically
2. **Preparation**: Technician reviews work order and gathers materials
3. **Scheduling**: Coordinated with Production to minimize downtime
4. **Execution**: Work performed following documented procedures
5. **Documentation**: All work logged with times and parts used
6. **Verification**: Supervisor verifies work completion
7. **Sign-Off**: Equipment cleared for production use

### Safety During Maintenance

- LOTO procedures always followed when required
- Confined space entry protocols if applicable
- Hot work permits for welding/cutting
- Fall protection for elevated work

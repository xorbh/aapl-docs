- **Material handling**: Use proper lifting techniques—forged parts may be heavy
- **Lubricants**: Some forging lubricants may be hazardous—follow MSDS guidelines
- **Noise**: Forging operations can be loud—always wear hearing protection
- **PPE**: Always wear safety glasses, hearing protection, and appropriate gloves
- **Machine guards**: Never operate machine with guards removed or bypassed
- **Emergency stop**: Know location of emergency stop and use immediately if unsafe condition occurs

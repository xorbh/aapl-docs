   - Full production run can proceed
   - FAI documentation filed with work order

---

## Step 1: First Piece Production

### Operator Prepares First Piece

1. Verify all equipment setup complete per WI-001 or applicable setup procedure
2. Verify supervisor signed off on setup completion
3. Load first piece of material:
   - Material is correct type and lot number
   - Material is secure in chuck/fixture
   - No interference with spindle or tools
4. Verify coolant flow operational
5. Verify safety guards in place
6. Run complete production cycle without interruption
7. Allow part to cool to room temperature (minimum 15 minutes)

### Remove & Initial Assessment

1. Carefully remove first piece from chuck/fixture
2. Visually inspect part at arm's length:
   - [ ] No visible cracks or breaks
   - [ ] No severe warping or distortion
   - [ ] Surface finish appears acceptable

   - [ ] Edges sharp and clean (if required) or deburred (if required)
   - [ ] No tool marks or chatter
   - [ ] No corrosion or discoloration (for materials that should be shiny)
4. Document visual findings on FAI form
5. If visual inspection fails, stop and notify supervisor

### Step 3B: Dimensional Inspection - Critical Dimensions

1. Identify critical dimensions from drawing:
   - Dimensions marked as CRITICAL or with special tolerance callouts
   - Functional dimensions affecting fit or assembly
   - Dimensions with tightest tolerances
   - Dimensions affecting mating parts

2. For each critical dimension:

   **Measure dimension**:
   - Select appropriate measurement tool (caliper, micrometer, gage)
   - Verify tool is zero'd or calibrated
   - Measure at minimum 3 different locations on part
   - Record each measurement
   - Calculate average if multiple measurements
   - Compare to specification on drawing

   **Evaluate result**:
   - If all measurements within tolerance: PASS
   - If any measurement outside tolerance: FAIL
   - Record on FAI form with actual dimensions

3. Continue until all critical dimensions inspected

### Step 3C: Dimensional Inspection - Secondary Dimensions

1. Identify secondary dimensions from drawing:
   - Non-critical dimensions
   - Looser tolerances
   - Dimensions not affecting assembly or function

2. Measure secondary dimensions:
   - Select appropriate measurement tool
   - Measure at representative location(s)
   - Record measurement and tolerance
   - Note pass/fail status

3. Secondary dimensions should pass, but not critical if slight deviation

### Step 3D: Surface Finish Inspection (if required)

1. If drawing specifies surface finish (Ra value):
   - Use surface roughness gage if available
   - Take measurement at 3 locations on part
   - Compare to specification
   - Record result on FAI form
   - Note if finish acceptable or needs improvement

2. If drawing specifies surface condition (smooth, polished, etc.):
   - Visually assess surface condition
   - Feel surface with finger if appropriate (for smoothness)
   - Compare to reference samples if available
   - Document assessment

   - For shafts, spindles, or rotating components
   - Rotate by hand and verify smooth motion
   - Check for binding, grinding, or excessive play
   - Verify bearing support adequate
   - Document smooth/rough/binding on form

2. **Sliding or Linear Motion Test**:
   - For sliding blocks, guides, or linear parts
   - Test movement along intended path
   - Verify smooth, unrestricted motion
   - Check for excessive play or binding
   - Record findings

3. **Fit Assembly Test**:
   - For parts that mate with other components
   - Test fit with mating part (if available)
   - Verify proper alignment and clearance
   - Check for interference or excessive gaps
   - Document fit assessment (tight, normal, loose)

### For Parts with Load-Bearing Function

1. Visual assessment of:
   - Wall thickness adequate
   - No visible cracks under load
   - Proper reinforcement at stress points
   - Correct material for application

2. If load testing required per specification:
   - Supervisor/engineer performs load test
   - Document load applied and results
   - Record part behavior under load

### For Parts Requiring Electrical Test

1. If part has electrical components or connections:
   - Verify connections secure and correct

## Tips for Accurate FAI Inspection

1. **Temperature Stability**: Allow parts to stabilize to room temperature before measuring (thermal expansion)
2. **Multiple Measurements**: Measure each dimension in multiple locations to detect variation
3. **Proper Tool Selection**: Use appropriate precision for dimension tolerance (if tolerance ±0.01", use calipers; if ±0.001", use micrometer)
4. **Clean Tools & Part**: Dirt on measuring surfaces affects accuracy
5. **Verify Drawing**: Always verify you have latest drawing revision
6. **Document Thoroughly**: Write clear notes - measurements and observations must be understandable
7. **When in Doubt**: Ask supervisor or Quality Manager for guidance
8. **Use Go/No-Go**: For high-volume inspections, use go/no-go gages when available

## Common FAI Failure Reasons & Corrections

| Failure Reason | Typical Cause | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| Dimension too large | Tool offset too small or tool worn | Increase tool offset; replace tool |
| Dimension too small | Tool offset too large | Decrease tool offset |
| Rough surface finish | Dull tool or too slow feed | Replace tool; increase feed rate |
| Chatter marks | Insufficient rigidity or spindle issue | Reduce spindle speed; reduce depth of cut |
| Warping or distortion | Material stress or incorrect cooling | Allow longer cooling time; verify fixture not over-clamping |
| Dimensional variation | Tool drift or repeatability issue | Verify tool holder security; check spindle runout |

## Step 2: Material & Workpiece Preparation

### Material Selection & Verification

1. Verify material type matches work order:
   - Check material specification on work order
   - Verify material received matches specification
   - Check material certification/test report if required
   - For critical welds, verify material traceability

2. Material preparation:
   - Clean material surface with wire brush:
     - Remove mill scale, rust, or oxidation
     - Surface should appear clean and bright
     - Do not use for stainless—see special procedures below
   - Remove oil or grease with solvent
   - Allow material to dry completely

### Special Material Preparation

**For Stainless Steel**:
1. Use stainless steel wire brush (dedicated, never used for other metals)
2. Brush thoroughly to remove oxide layer
3. Clean with stainless-safe cleaner
4. Do NOT use carbon steel brush on stainless (contamination)

**For Aluminum**:
1. Brush to remove oxide layer
2. Clean with acetone or prescribed solvent
3. Dry thoroughly (aluminum oxidizes rapidly)
4. Weld as soon as possible after cleaning

**For High-Carbon Steel**:
1. Standard carbon steel wire brush acceptable
2. Remove all scale and rust
3. Material should be bright metal color
4. If heavy corrosion, use angle grinder with wire wheel

### Fit-Up & Alignment

1. **Joint Preparation**:
   - Position parts per engineering drawing
   - Verify joint type (butt, lap, corner, tee)
   - Ensure gap is correct:
     - Typical butt joint: 1/16" - 1/8" gap
     - Lap joint: surfaces flush with no gaps
     - Corner/tee: surfaces at correct angle
   - Use spacers if needed to achieve proper gap

2. **Alignment & Clamping**:
   - Clamp workpieces securely to work table
   - Verify alignment with straightedge or template
   - Check that clamps do not interfere with torch access
   - Verify parts cannot shift during welding
   - Allow access for torch movement along entire joint

3. **Tack Welds** (temporary welds to hold parts):
   - Create tack welds at ends of joint:
     - 1/4" - 1/2" tack weld (very small)
     - Space tacks 6-12" apart on longer joints
   - Use minimum heat to avoid part distortion
   - Tack welds will be consumed by main weld

## Step 4: Welding Process - Trial Run

### Test Weld on Scrap Material

1. **Setup test weld**:
   - Place scrap material of same type on work table
   - Prepare short joint (2-3" length minimum)
   - Position like production weld

2. **First arc start**:
   - Position torch over joint at correct angle:
     - MIG: torch at 90° to joint (perpendicular)
     - TIG: electrode at 75-80° to base metal
   - Contact wire to material (MIG) or strike arc (TIG)
   - Hold stable arc as weld begins
   - Observe melt pool formation

3. **Observe weld process**:
   - Melt pool should form smoothly
   - For MIG: listen for distinctive "snap, crackle, pop" sound
   - For TIG: watch for controlled pool formation
   - Verify shielding gas is protecting weld
   - Check penetration (filler flowing smoothly)

4. **Travel along joint**:
   - Move torch smoothly along joint
   - Maintain consistent speed
   - Hold torch angle constant
   - Keep arc in melt pool (don't burn too hot)

5. **Stop weld**:
   - Gradually reduce current or pull away smoothly
   - Fill any crater at end of weld
   - Allow weld to cool naturally

6. **Inspect test weld**:
   - Remove slag or flux (brush if applicable)
   - Visually inspect bead:
     - Bead should be uniform in width
     - Bead should be smooth with no spatter
     - No holes or voids in bead
     - Good fusion with base metal
   - If test weld acceptable, proceed to production
   - If not acceptable, adjust parameters and re-test

---

## Step 5: Production Welding

### Production Weld Execution

1. **Position prepared workpieces**:
   - Ensure clean fit-up as prepared
   - Verify tack welds present and secure
   - Position torch/electrode ready

2. **Start the weld**:
   - Position torch/electrode above start point
   - Arc strike (TIG) or wire contact (MIG)
   - Watch for stable meld pool
   - Allow 1-2" lead-in distance before actual weld joint

3. **Weld main joint**:
   - Travel steadily along joint
   - Maintain consistent torch angle
   - Keep arc length constant
   - Watch melt pool—should be slightly ahead of arc
   - Continue along entire joint length

4. **Weld completion**:
   - As you approach end of joint, slow travel speed slightly
   - Fill any crater at weld end
   - Break arc/pull away smoothly
   - Avoid porosity from fast cooling

5. **Allow cooling**:
   - Let weld cool naturally (do NOT quench unless specified)
   - Do not move piece until solidified (minimum 1-2 minutes)
   - Allow access for next weld if multi-pass joint

### Multi-Pass Welding (for thicker materials)

For materials over 1/4" thick requiring multiple passes:

1. **First pass (root)** :
   - Small bead penetrating to bottom of joint
   - May use reduced heat
   - Essential for good fusion

2. **Intermediate passes**:
   - Build up weld gradually
   - Each pass 1/4" - 1/2" wide
   - Clean between passes:
     - Remove slag with wire brush
     - Verify no cracks or defects before next pass

3. **Final pass (cap)**:
   - Larger bead for appearance
   - Last pass seen from outside
   - Should be smooth and uniform

## Step 6: Weld Quality Inspection

### Immediate Post-Weld Inspection

1. **Visual inspection while warm**:
   - Check bead profile:
     - [ ] Smooth, uniform width
     - [ ] Good penetration to base metal
     - [ ] No visible porosity or holes
     - [ ] Spatter minimal (or removed)
   - Check for cracks:
     - [ ] No surface cracks visible
     - [ ] Look especially at ends and corners
     - [ ] Check heat-affected zone
   - Check for undercut:
     - [ ] No gouging along edges of weld
     - [ ] Width consistent throughout

2. **Cooling & measurement**:
   - Allow weld to cool to room temperature (30+ minutes)
   - Measure weld bead:
     - Width (should match specification)
     - Height/reinforcement
     - Length (entire joint)
   - Compare to requirements on work order

3. **Functional assessment**:
   - If tensile test required, note for testing
   - If bend test required, prepare sample
   - If X-ray required, mark location for inspection

### Post-Weld Testing (if required)

1. **Tensile Test** (if specified):
   - Prepare sample from weld
   - Test pulls joint to failure
   - Compare strength to specification

2. **Bend Test** (for qualifications or critical welds):
   - Bend weld sample to 180°
   - Inspect for cracking
   - No cracks acceptable

3. **Dye Penetrant Test** (for surface cracks):
   - Professional test (not typically operator-performed)
   - Detects surface and near-surface cracks
   - Results document acceptability

4. **X-Ray Inspection** (for critical applications):
   - Professional radiography service
   - Detects internal voids or defects
   - Results compared to acceptance criteria

## Step 7: Weld Cleanup & Finishing

### Immediate Cleanup

1. Remove slag/flux:
   - Use wire brush to remove loose slag
   - Brush should be dedicated (not used for other metals)
   - For stainless: use stainless wire brush only
   - Brush until metal shows through

2. Remove spatter:
   - For MIG: spatter normal, can remove with chip brush
   - Chip brush may remove small spatter
   - Heavy spatter can be chipped off with chisel
   - Be careful not to damage base metal

3. Clean joint area:
   - Remove any dust or debris
   - Wipe clean with cloth
   - Part should be clean and ready

### Heat Treatment (if required)

1. Check work order for post-weld heat treatment:
   - Stress relief required?
   - Annealing required?
   - Material-specific requirements?

2. If heat treatment required:
   - Mark part clearly
   - Coordinate with heat treat department
   - Allow to cool first before moving to furnace area
   - Document heat treat parameters

### Final Inspection & Documentation

1. Final visual check:
   - One last examination before shipment
   - Verify no missed areas
   - Verify weld meets specification
   - Verify appearance acceptable

2. Document completion:
   - Record on work order:
     - Weld completed by (welder name)
     - Weld parameters used
     - Inspection results
     - Pass/fail status
   - Sign and date documentation
   - File in work order

## Step 8: Equipment Shutdown & Cleanup

### Post-Operation Equipment Care

1. **Power down equipment**:
   - Turn off welding machine
   - If TIG torch cooled, allow coolant to drain
   - If gas bottle open, turn valve closed
   - Allow equipment to cool 5-10 minutes

2. **Clean work area**:
   - Remove all finished weldments
   - Sweep or collect all welding debris:
     - Spatter (metal)
     - Slag (flux residue)
   - Place metal in scrap bin
   - Discard flux/slag in designated waste

3. **Torch/Electrode maintenance**:
   - Wipe torch clean of spatter
   - For TIG torch, verify no tungsten loss
   - Store torch carefully to avoid damage
   - Electrode holder stored securely

4. **Work area preparation for next shift**:
   - Clear all clamping fixtures
   - Store fixtures appropriately
   - Leave table clean and organized
   - Verify no safety hazards

## Safety Reminders

- **Arc rays**: Always wear helmet when welding (never look at arc with bare eyes)
- **Fumes**: Ensure adequate ventilation—fumes are toxic
- **Hot metal**: Allow welds to cool—heat dissipates quickly but material stays hot
- **Fire hazard**: Keep fire extinguisher nearby, never leave hot work unattended
- **Electrical hazard**: Do not touch electrode or ground clamp while arc active
- **PPE**: Always wear gloves, apron, and closed-toe shoes
- **Gas cylinders**: Handle with care, never drop or expose to extreme temperatures

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Poor Arc Starting
- [ ] Verify material is clean and dry
- [ ] Check electrode/wire is fresh
- [ ] Verify power is on and set correctly
- [ ] For TIG: check tungsten is sharp, not balled
- [ ] Test on scrap material first

### Problem: Porosity in Weld (holes/voids)
- [ ] Verify gas shielding adequate (check flow)
- [ ] Verify gas mixture correct for material
- [ ] Check travel speed not too fast
- [ ] Verify material clean before welding

### Problem: Undercut (groove along weld edge)
- [ ] Reduce welding heat/amperage
- [ ] Slow travel speed slightly
- [ ] Angle torch more perpendicular to joint
- [ ] May require multiple passes instead of single high-heat pass

### Problem: Cold Joint (incomplete fusion)
- [ ] Increase heat slightly
- [ ] Slow travel speed to allow better fusion
- [ ] Ensure adequate cleaning before weld
- [ ] Verify joint gap is correct

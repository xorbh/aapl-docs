## Step 2: Grinding Wheel Inspection & Change (if needed)

### Wheel Selection & Inspection

1. Verify correct wheel for application:
   - Check work order specifications
   - Review wheel type required (aluminum oxide, ceramic, diamond)
   - Verify wheel grit matches requirement
   - Confirm wheel diameter appropriate for machine

2. If wheel change required:
   - [ ] **Power off machine completely**
   - [ ] **Apply LOTO tag** if required by facility
   - [ ] Allow wheel to come to complete stop (wait 3-5 minutes)
   - [ ] Open wheel guard access

3. Inspect current wheel:
   - Spin wheel slowly by hand—verify balanced
   - Look for visible cracks (especially around center hole)
   - Check for chips or damage
   - Assess wheel dress (if worn or glazed, will need dressing)

### Wheel Removal (if needed)

1. Locate wheel retaining nut
2. Place wheel holder tool on spindle nose
3. Using wrench, turn retaining nut counterclockwise:
   - *Note: Reverse thread—turn left to loosen*
   - Turn slowly and firmly
   - Do not force if stuck—apply penetrating oil and wait
4. Remove old wheel carefully (can be heavy)
5. Place used wheel in designated storage area
6. Clean spindle nose thoroughly:
   - Remove chips and dust
   - Wipe with dry cloth
   - Verify spindle nose thread clean

### Wheel Installation

1. Inspect new wheel:
   - Check wheel diameter marked on wheel
   - Inspect for cracks or damage
   - Ring wheel with mallet—should sound clear/pure tone
   - If cracked sound or dull thud, reject wheel
2. Place new wheel on spindle nose:
   - Align hole with spindle
   - Seat wheel fully
3. Install retaining nut:
   - Turn counterclockwise slowly (remember: reverse thread)
   - Tighten firmly but do not over-tighten
   - Wheel should rotate freely by hand
4. Close wheel guard
5. Perform slow rotation test (no load):
   - Power on machine
   - Observe wheel rotation for runout
   - If wheel wobbles or vibrates, stop and reinspect
6. Turn off machine

## Step 3: Wheel Dressing (if required)

### When Wheel Dressing is Needed

- New wheel before first use
- Wheel is glazed (shiny, no cutting action)
- Wheel is clogged with material buildup
- Wheel shows uneven wear
- Previous operator notes indicate dressing needed

### Wheel Dressing Procedure

1. **Setup for Dressing**:
   - Ensure machine is powered on
   - Wheel spinning at normal operating speed
   - Coolant system on
   - Operator wearing safety glasses with side shields

2. **Diamond Dresser Technique**:
   - Position dresser tool holder on magnetic chuck
   - Adjust position so dresser contacts wheel edge
   - Move dresser tool slowly across wheel face
   - One smooth pass, light pressure
   - Do not force dresser into wheel
   - Allow multiple passes for complete dressing:
     - First pass: light pressure, slow feed
     - Second pass: normal pressure
     - Third pass: light pressure (light dressing final pass)

3. **Verification**:
   - Wheel should be sharp and ready to cut
   - Dress again if wheel still glazed
   - Listen for crisp cutting sound vs. grinding sound

## Step 4: Coolant System Preparation

### Coolant Verification

1. Check coolant type:
   - Work order specifies coolant requirement
   - Confirm correct coolant currently loaded
   - Never mix coolant types
   - If wrong type, drain and refill

2. Verify coolant concentration:
   - Use coolant concentration tester
   - Measure actual concentration (typically 5-10% for grinding)
   - If too weak, add coolant concentrate
   - If too strong, dilute with water
   - Record adjustment on maintenance log

3. Assess coolant condition:
   - Smell coolant—should be clean, not musty
   - Look for floating particles or debris
   - If condition poor:
     - Drain coolant completely
     - Flush system with water
     - Refill with fresh coolant

4. Start coolant pump:
   - Turn on coolant system
   - Verify flow from nozzles
   - Adjust nozzle position to direct coolant to grind point
   - Flow should be steady, not pulsing

## Step 5: Setup & Workpiece Mounting

### Workpiece Preparation

1. Clean workpiece surface:
   - Remove dust and debris with dry cloth
   - Wipe magnetic chuck clean
   - Verify no chips on workpiece
   - Never grind a dirty surface

2. For magnetic chuck mounting:
   - Place workpiece on chuck
   - Verify part lies flat on chuck surface
   - Part should not rock or move by hand
   - Power on magnetic chuck
   - Test security—try to lift part with hand
   - Part should be immobile

3. For fixture mounting:
   - Ensure fixture is clean
   - Mount fixture per setup instructions
   - Place workpiece in fixture
   - Verify part is secure in fixture
   - Part should not shift or move

### Grinding Plane Setup

1. Determine grinding plane from work order:
   - Is grinding flat surface, cylindrical surface, or angular surface?
   - Identify exact dimensions and tolerances

2. Position workpiece:
   - Adjust work height so grinding point is at wheel centerline
   - Use height adjustment on table
   - Measure from wheel center to top of workpiece
   - Use precision spacers to achieve exact height

3. For cylindrical or angular grinding:
   - Use sine plate if required for angle
   - Position workpiece axis parallel to table motion
   - Verify precise angle setup

### Reference Dimension Establishment

1. Measure current workpiece height/position from reference
2. Mark starting position:
   - Record table position reading on DRO (Digital Readout) if equipped
   - Or mark position with marker/tape
3. Record baseline dimension:
   - Measure current dimension with micrometer
   - Record on setup sheet
   - This is reference for grinding amount

## Step 6: Initial Grinding Setup

### Low-Speed Test Grind

1. Power on machine
2. Verify all systems operational:
   - Wheel spinning normally
   - Coolant flowing
   - Table moving smoothly
3. Set spindle speed:
   - For most grinding: 1,000-3,000 RPM wheel surface speed
   - Consult wheel specifications for recommended speed
   - Check machine manual for actual RPM setting
4. Perform slow approach:
   - Manually move table toward wheel very slowly
   - Listen and watch for wheel contact
   - First contact should be light
   - Stop before wheel engages deeply

5. Test grind first pass:
   - Engage feed for very short distance (1/4 inch maximum)
   - Observe grinding process:
     - Grinding should sound crisp, not squealing
     - Chips should flow with coolant
     - No smoking or burning
   - Check surface appearance after pass
6. Remove workpiece and measure:
   - Measure dimension after first pass
   - Compare to baseline—record grinding amount
   - Verify grinding amount is expected
   - If too little or too much material removed, adjust setup

## Step 7: Precision Grinding Operation

### Grinding Parameters

1. **Spindle Speed** (wheel surface speed):
   - Most materials: 5,000-6,500 surface feet per minute (SFM)
   - Aluminum: 3,000-4,000 SFM (softer material, faster wheel speed)
   - Steel: 5,000-6,000 SFM
   - Cast iron: 4,000-5,000 SFM

2. **Table Feed Rate**:
   - Finish grinding: 0.5-2.0 inches per minute
   - Rough grinding: 2-5 inches per minute
   - Depends on machine capabilities and workpiece

3. **Depth of Cut Per Pass**:
   - Finish: 0.0005"-0.001" per pass
   - Semi-finish: 0.001"-0.002" per pass
   - Rough: 0.002"-0.005" per pass

### Grinding Procedure

1. **First Pass**:
   - Set table feed to slow speed (safety)
   - Engage automatic feed
   - Monitor grinding action carefully
   - Watch for excessive vibration or noise
   - Verify coolant reaches grinding zone
   - Allow grinding wheel to do work (don't force)

2. **Subsequent Passes**:
   - After each pass, stop and inspect workpiece
   - Wipe away coolant and chips
   - Measure dimension with precision tool
   - Compare to drawing specification
   - Calculate remaining stock to remove
   - If dimension acceptable, STOP grinding

3. **Final Finish Pass**:
   - Last pass uses light depth of cut (0.0005")
   - Fine feed rate for quality finish
   - Allows wheel to cut cleanly
   - Results in smooth, precise finish

### In-Process Monitoring

Every 5-10 parts or every 30 minutes:
1. Stop grinding operation
2. Remove part and cool to room temperature
3. Measure critical dimensions
4. Compare to drawing specification
5. If dimensions drifting, adjust wheel feed
6. If dimensions shifting significantly, re-dress wheel
7. Document measurements on production log

## Step 8: Final Verification & Completion

### Part Quality Assessment

1. Final dimension verification:
   - Measure all dimensions specified in work order
   - Use appropriate precision tool for tolerance
   - All dimensions must be within tolerance
   - Record final dimensions on form

2. Surface finish evaluation:
   - Visual inspection—surface should be smooth
   - If required, use surface roughness gage
   - Compare to specification (typically Ra 0.4-0.8)
   - Feel surface with finger if appropriate
   - Surface should be smooth and consistent

3. Part integrity check:
   - Visually inspect for cracks
   - Check for burns or discoloration (sign of overheating)
   - Verify no debris embedded in surface
   - Part should appear clean and polished

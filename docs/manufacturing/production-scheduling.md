*Production planning and scheduling coordination*

### Weekly Planning Meeting

Held every Monday at 8:00 AM with:
- Production Manager
- Manufacturing Engineers
- Quality Lead
- Shipping/Logistics Representative

**Agenda**:
- Review previous week's performance metrics
- Prioritize incoming orders
- Identify capacity constraints
- Plan workforce and equipment allocation

### Order Prioritization

Orders are prioritized based on:
1. **Delivery Date**: Earlier deadlines first (EDD rule)
2. **Customer Priority**: Premium customers or service level agreements
3. **Product Type**: Grouped by similar manufacturing requirements
4. **Batch Size**: Larger orders may have scheduling priority
5. **Equipment Availability**: Complex orders scheduled when equipment available

## Schedule Management

### Master Schedule

The master production schedule covers:
- **Horizon**: 12 weeks forward
- **Rolling**: Updated weekly with new information
- **Granularity**: Daily for current week, weekly for future weeks
- **Tool**: Maintained in production scheduling software

### Capacity Planning

**Equipment Capacity**:
- Review machine utilization rates
- Schedule preventive maintenance during low-demand periods
- Reserve capacity (85% target utilization)
- Plan for seasonal demand variations

**Labor Capacity**:
- Track available shifts and operators
- Account for training and skill requirements
- Schedule cross-training during low periods
- Plan for expected absences

### Lead Time Management

Standard lead times by product type:
- **Type A Products**: 2 weeks
- **Type B Products**: 3 weeks
- **Type C Products**: 4 weeks
- **Custom Orders**: 6+ weeks (requires sales approval)

## Production Control

### Work Order Release

- Work orders released 1 week before scheduled start date
- Includes:
  - Bill of materials (BOM)
  - Quality requirements
  - Setup procedures
  - Expected cycle times
  - Customer special instructions

### Production Tracking

**Daily Status Update**:
- Quantity completed
- Quality issues
- Equipment downtime
- Staffing adjustments
- Estimated completion

**Weekly Report**:
- On-time delivery metrics
- Production efficiency metrics
- Quality metrics
- Equipment utilization
- Variance from schedule

## Handling Schedule Disruptions

### Emergency Orders

- Require approval from Production Manager and Sales Director
- May incur expedite surcharge
- Assessed against available capacity
- Documentation required

### Equipment Downtime

Response protocol:
1. Immediately notify Production Manager
2. Assess impact on schedule
3. Consider alternative equipment or outsourcing
4. Update customer if delivery affected
5. Root cause analysis within 24 hours

### Material Shortages

Resolution steps:
1. Notify Purchasing immediately
2. Check inventory for alternative materials
3. Contact supplier for expedited delivery
4. Consider order splitting or prioritization
5. Update customer if delivery impact >2 days

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Schedule Performance

| Metric | Target | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| On-Time Delivery | 98% | Weekly |
| Schedule Adherence | 95% | Weekly |
| Forecast Accuracy | 90% | Weekly |
| Lead Time Variance | ±10% | Monthly |

### Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Target | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Equipment Utilization | 85% | Weekly |
| Labor Productivity | 95% | Weekly |
| Cycle Time Variance | ±5% | Daily |
| Setup Time | <2 hours | Weekly |

## System Requirements

### Data Entry

All production staff must enter:
- Start and completion times
- Quantity produced and scrapped
- Equipment issues or adjustments
- Quality inspection results

### Report Generation

Standard reports:
- Daily production report (8 AM)

## Best Practices

1. **Buffer Time**: Add 10% buffer to estimated production times
2. **Batch Sizing**: Group similar products to reduce setup time
3. **Preventive Maintenance**: Schedule during planned low periods
4. **Communication**: Daily standups for current week status
5. **Flexibility**: Maintain flexibility for urgent orders
